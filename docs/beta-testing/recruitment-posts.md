**Title:** [Beta Testers Wanted] Bitbucket DataCenter MCP Server - Semantic Search + AI Integration

**Body:**

Hi r/bitbucket community! 👋

We're looking for **10-20 beta testers** for a new open-source project that brings AI-powered semantic search and automation to Bitbucket DataCenter.

### What is it?

The **Bitbucket DataCenter MCP Server** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants (like Claude) to intelligently interact with your Bitbucket DC instance:

- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Find Bitbucket operations using natural language (e.g., "create repository" → get_schemas_create_issue)
- 🤖 **AI Integration**: Execute Bitbucket operations directly from AI conversations
- 🔐 **Multi-Auth Support**: OAuth 2.0, PAT, OAuth 1.0a, Basic Auth
- ⚡ **High Performance**: <500ms search latency, optimized for production use
- 🐳 **Zero Config**: Docker or npm install, interactive setup wizard

### What we're looking for:

- **Bitbucket DC experience** (access to a DC instance for testing)
- **Basic technical skills** (comfortable with npm/Docker)
- **2-week availability** (3-5 hours total time commitment)
- **Willingness to provide detailed feedback**

### What you'll get:

- ✅ Early access before public launch
- ✅ Direct support from the dev team
- ✅ Recognition in v1.0 release notes
- ✅ Influence on final features and priorities

### Testing Timeline:

- **Duration**: 2 weeks (starting [DATE])
- **Checkpoint meetings**: Week 1, Week 2
- **Scenarios to test**: 10+ workflows covering all features

### How to apply:

Fill out this quick application form: **[FORM LINK]**

We'll review applications and select testers by **[DATE]**.
