## Dev Notes

### Story Overview

This story orchestrates the beta testing program and v1.0 launch preparation for the bitbucket-datacenter-mcp-server project. It involves coordinating external testers, collecting and triaging feedback, fixing critical bugs, validating performance benchmarks, and executing the public launch across multiple channels (npm, Docker Hub, GitHub).

This is primarily a project management and quality assurance story rather than a development story. Most tasks involve coordination, documentation, and process execution rather than code changes.

### Previous Story Context

Stories 4.1-4.9 have created all the technical foundation and documentation needed for launch:
- Interactive setup wizard (4.1)
- Docker packaging (4.2)
- npm global install (4.3)
- Config management (4.4)
- Documentation suite (4.5-4.9)

Story 4.9 (Contributing Guidelines) is currently "Approved" rather than "Done", but we're proceeding in YOLO mode. This story assumes all documentation from 4.1-4.9 is complete and ready for beta tester consumption.

### Beta Testing Scope

**Target Beta Testers:**
- 10-20 developers with Bitbucket DC experience
- Mix of experience levels (beginners to advanced)
- Active in relevant communities (Reddit r/bitbucket, Atlassian Community, Discord)
- Available for 2-week testing commitment

**Testing Coverage:**
- All authentication methods: OAuth 2.0, PAT, OAuth 1.0a, Basic Auth [Source: prd/epic-3-multi-auth-production-resilience.md]
- All MCP tools: search_ids, get_id, call_id [Source: prd/epic-2-mcp-server-operation-execution.md]
- Common workflows: Issue CRUD operations, searches, bulk operations
- Edge cases: Network failures, invalid inputs, rate limiting
- Performance: Latency, throughput, resource consumption

### Performance Targets to Validate

[Source: architecture/performance-benchmarks-slas.md]

**Latency Targets:**
- search_ids: p95 <500ms, p99 <1s
- get_id (cache hit): p95 <100ms
- get_id (cache miss): p95 <200ms
- call_id (excluding Bitbucket): p95 <500ms

**Throughput Targets:**
- Concurrent searches: ≥100 req/s
- Concurrent call_id: ≥100 req/s
- Mixed workload: ≥100 req/s

**Resource Targets:**
- Memory (idle): <512MB
- Memory (under load): <1GB
- CPU (sustained): <50%
- Startup time: <5s

### Bug Priority Definitions

**P0 (Critical - Fix Immediately):**
- Application crashes or hangs
- Data loss or corruption
- Security vulnerabilities
- Authentication complete failures
- Core functionality broken (search/execute operations)

**P1 (High - Fix Before Launch):**
- Major UX issues affecting usability
- Performance degradation beyond SLA targets
- Documentation gaps causing confusion
- Partial functionality failures (edge cases)
- Error messages unclear or misleading

**P2 (Medium - Backlog for v1.1):**
- Minor bugs not affecting core functionality
- Cosmetic issues (formatting, layout)
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Feature requests beyond v1.0 scope
- Non-critical performance optimizations

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

This story requires validation of existing test coverage rather than creating new tests:

**Coverage Validation:**
- Run: `npm run test:coverage`
- Target: ≥80% coverage across all modules
- If below target, identify gaps and add tests before launch

**Performance Benchmarking:**
- Create benchmark suite in `tests/benchmarks/performance.test.ts` (if not already exists)
- Benchmark tools: search_ids, get_id, call_id
- Measure latencies and throughput under various load conditions
- Document results and compare against SLA targets

**Integration Testing:**
- Validate all authentication methods work end-to-end
- Test MCP protocol handshake and tool registration
- Verify Bitbucket API client with real Bitbucket DC instance (or mock)

**E2E Testing:**
- Run full workflow tests: search → get → call
- Test error recovery scenarios
- Validate circuit breaker and retry logic

### Technical Constraints

**Beta Testing Period:**
- Duration: 2 weeks
- Checkpoint meetings: Week 1, Week 2
- Daily support channel monitoring required

**Release Timing:**
- Target: End of Week 11 in sprint plan
- Flexible based on bug fix completion
- No launch if P0 bugs remaining or >3 P1 bugs

**Platform Support:**
- Node.js 22+ LTS (as per tech stack)
- OS: Linux, macOS, Windows (matrix builds in CI)
- Docker: amd64 and arm64 architectures

**Versioning:**
- Follow semantic versioning (SemVer 2.0)
- v1.0.0 is first public release
- No pre-release tags (alpha/beta) for v1.0

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk: Insufficient Beta Tester Participation**
- Mitigation: Over-recruit (target 20 to ensure 10+ active)
- Mitigation: Offer incentives (early access, contributor recognition)
- Mitigation: Keep testing scenarios short and focused

**Risk: Critical Bugs Found Late in Beta**
- Mitigation: Early checkpoint at Week 1 to catch issues
- Mitigation: Prioritize P0 fixes with 24-48 hour turnaround
- Mitigation: Consider delayed launch if necessary

**Risk: Performance Targets Not Met**
- Mitigation: Run benchmarks early in beta period
- Mitigation: Identify optimization opportunities proactively
- Mitigation: Document known performance limitations

**Risk: Documentation Gaps Discovered**
- Mitigation: Update docs immediately based on tester feedback
- Mitigation: Maintain FAQ section in beta testing guide
- Mitigation: Add troubleshooting entries for common issues

### Success Metrics

**Beta Testing Success:**
- 10-20 active testers completing scenarios
- 50+ feedback items collected (bugs, UX, features)
- 100% of testing scenarios executed by at least 3 testers
- Average satisfaction score ≥7/10

**Launch Readiness:**
- Zero P0 bugs
- <3 P1 bugs (with workarounds)
- All performance targets met or exceeded
- Test coverage ≥80%

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (2025-10-19)

### Debug Log References
- None required - straightforward document creation tasks

### Completion Notes
**Technical Deliverables Completed**:
1. Created comprehensive `docs/beta-testing-guide.md` with 10+ testing scenarios
2. Created `docs/beta-testing/beta-tester-profile.md` with recruitment criteria
3. Created `docs/beta-testing/recruitment-posts.md` with platform-specific templates
4. Created `docs/beta-testing/testing-scenarios-detailed.md` with comprehensive test specs
5. Created `docs/beta-testing/feedback-tracking.md` template for collecting beta feedback
6. Created `docs/beta-testing/launch-checklist.md` with complete pre-launch validation

**Test Coverage Validation**:
- Attempted coverage run - 638/731 tests passing (87.3% test pass rate)
- Some test failures in integration tests (auth_method validation) and Docker build tests
- These failures should be addressed before launching, but are not blocking for documentation creation

**Human Process Steps Required** (Cannot be automated by dev agent):
- Task 1.6: Review applications and select 10-20 beta testers
- Task 2.5: Set up support channel (Discord/Slack)
- Task 2.6: Send beta testing guide to selected testers
- Task 4: Execute entire beta testing program (2 weeks)
- Task 5: Collect and categorize feedback
- Task 6: Fix bugs based on beta feedback
- Task 7 (Subtasks 7.1-7.7): Launch checklist validation steps (many require actual beta results)
- Task 8: Performance validation (requires running benchmarks after bug fixes)
- Task 9: Prepare and publish launch assets
- Task 10: Execute v1.0 release (npm publish, Docker push, GitHub release)

**Recommendations**:
1. Fix the 93 failing tests before beta testing (especially auth_method validation and Docker build issues)
2. Run `npm run test:coverage` after test fixes to validate ≥80% coverage
3. Execute performance benchmarks before beta testing to establish baseline
4. Use the created feedback-tracking.md template during beta testing
5. Follow the launch-checklist.md systematically before publishing v1.0
