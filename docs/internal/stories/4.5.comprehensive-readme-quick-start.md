## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 4.4 (Auto-Discovery & Config Validation) completed config loading with priority order (CLI flags → Env vars → Config file → Defaults) and Zod-based validation. README should reference this flexible config approach in quick start section.

### Project Structure Context

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- **README Location:** `README.md` in project root (top-level)
- **Documentation Directory:** `docs/` contains all extended documentation
  - `docs/authentication.md` - Auth setup guide (link from README)
  - `docs/api-reference.md` - MCP tools reference (link from README)
  - `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Troubleshooting guide (link from README)
  - `docs/cookbook.md` - Usage examples (link from README)
- **Contributing Guidelines:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` in project root (link from README)
- **License File:** `LICENSE` in project root (MIT)
- **Images Directory:** Store screenshots/GIFs in `docs/images/` for organization

### Key Technical Details

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Runtime Requirements:**
- Node.js 22+ LTS (must be documented in README)
- npm 9+ package manager
- Cross-platform: Linux, macOS, Windows

**Installation Methods:**
1. **Docker:** Single command using official image (from Story 4.2)
2. **npm Global:** `npm install -g bitbucket-dc-mcp` then `bitbucket-mcp setup` (from Story 4.3)
3. **Source:** Clone, build with TypeScript compiler, run setup

**Key Features to Highlight:**
- Semantic search with >90% relevance using sqlite-vec
- Multi-auth support: OAuth 2.0, PAT, OAuth 1.0a, Basic Auth
- Production resilience: Circuit breaker, rate limiting, retry logic
- Zero-config setup: Interactive wizard <5 minutes
- 3 MCP tools: search_ids, get_id, call_id

### Documentation Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Clear, concise language (target: non-expert users)
- Code examples must be executable (test them)
- Use proper Markdown formatting (headings, lists, code blocks)
- Include links to deeper documentation for advanced topics
- Screenshots should have descriptive alt text for accessibility

### README Structure Best Practices

**Standard Sections:**
1. **Title & Badges** - Project name, status badges (build, coverage, version)
2. **Project Description** - 1-2 paragraphs: what, why, how
3. **Key Features** - Bullet list of main capabilities
4. **Table of Contents** - Links to major sections (for long READMEs)
5. **Quick Start** - Fastest path to get running (<5 min)
6. **Installation** - Detailed installation options
7. **Usage** - Basic examples and common workflows
8. **Documentation** - Links to full docs
9. **Contributing** - How to contribute (link to CONTRIBUTING.md)
10. **License** - License info (MIT)
11. **Acknowledgments** - Credits (optional)

### Badge Integration

**GitHub Actions Badges:**
```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
```

**npm Badge:**
```markdown
![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/bitbucket-dc-mcp.svg)
```

**License Badge:**
```markdown
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
```

**Coverage Badge:** Integration with coverage service (Codecov, Coveralls) required

### Visual Assets Guidelines

**Screenshots:**
- Setup wizard: Show interactive prompts and successful completion
- Search results: Show semantic search returning relevant operations
- LLM interaction: Show Claude Desktop or similar using MCP tools

**Image Optimization:**
- Format: PNG for screenshots, GIF for animations
- Max width: 800-1000px for GitHub display
- Compress: Use tools like ImageOptim, TinyPNG
- Alt text: Descriptive for accessibility

### Quick Start Examples

**Docker Example:**
```bash
docker run -e BITBUCKET_URL=https://bitbucket.example.com -e BITBUCKET_TOKEN=<token> ghcr.io/owner/bitbucket-dc-mcp
```

**npm Example:**
```bash
npm install -g bitbucket-dc-mcp
bitbucket-mcp setup
```

**Source Example:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/owner/bitbucket-dc-mcp.git
cd bitbucket-dc-mcp
npm install && npm run build
npm run setup
```

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Manual Testing Required:**
- Test all installation paths from README instructions
- Verify all commands execute successfully
- Validate all links navigate correctly
- Check badges display and link properly
- Test on fresh environment (no prior config)

**Test Coverage:**
- No automated unit tests for README content (manual testing only)
- Integration tests ensure commands referenced in README work correctly
- Consider README validation linter (e.g., remark-lint for Markdown)

**Documentation Testing:**
- All code snippets must be executable
- Screenshots should be current (not outdated)
- Links should not be broken (automated link checker recommended)

### No Specific Data Models or API Specs

This story focuses on documentation content creation. No backend data models, database schemas, or API endpoints are involved. The README documents the MCP tools (search_ids, get_id, call_id) but does not implement them.

### Configuration Reference

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md, Story 4.4]

**Config Methods to Document:**
1. **CLI flags** (highest priority)
2. **Environment variables** (BITBUCKET_URL, BITBUCKET_AUTH_METHOD, BITBUCKET_TOKEN, etc.)
3. **Config file** (`~/.bitbucket-mcp/config.yml`)
4. **Defaults** (rate_limit=100, timeout=30s, log_level=INFO)

Quick start should mention setup wizard handles config, but advanced users can use env vars or config files directly.

### Review Process

**Internal Review:**
- Scrum Master reviews for completeness
- Dev lead reviews technical accuracy
- Product owner reviews messaging/positioning

**External Review (if available):**
- Tech writer for clarity and structure
- 3-5 beta testers for user perspective
- Community feedback after initial publish

### Success Criteria

**User Goal:** New user can understand product and complete setup in <5 minutes using README alone

**Validation:**
- 3 beta testers successfully complete quick start without external help
- README feedback survey: >4/5 rating for clarity
- Setup time measured: <5 minutes average
