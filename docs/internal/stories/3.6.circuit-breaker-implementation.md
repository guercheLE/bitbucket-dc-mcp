# Story 3.6: Circuit Breaker Implementation

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** circuit breaker pattern implementado para proteger contra cascading failures quando Bitbucket DC está down,
**so that** sistema gracefully degrada e não sobrecarrega Bitbucket com requests quando está com problemas.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Classe `CircuitBreaker` em `src/core/circuit-breaker.ts` implementada com estados: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
2. Circuit breaker wraps `BitbucketClientService.executeOperation()` method
3. Estado CLOSED: requests passam normalmente, failures são tracked
4. Estado OPEN: requests fail-fast sem chamar Bitbucket, retorna error "Circuit breaker is OPEN, Bitbucket DC may be down"
5. Threshold para abrir: 5 failures consecutivos OU 50% failure rate em 10s window
6. Estado HALF_OPEN: após timeout (30s default), permite 1 request de teste. Se sucesso → CLOSED, se falha → OPEN
7. Circuit breaker tem metrics: state, failure count, success count, last state change timestamp
8. Circuit breaker loga: state transitions com rationale, health check results
9. Circuit breaker é configurável: failure threshold, timeout, window size
10. Unit tests validam: state transitions, thresholds, health checks, concurrent requests handling

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Context

From Story 3.5 (Secure Credential Storage), we established:

- Error handling patterns with custom error classes
- Logger integration with pino for structured logging
- Configuration management patterns
- Unit testing with Vitest mocking

From Story 2.4 (Bitbucket API Client Service), we know:

- `BitbucketClientService` handles all HTTP requests to Bitbucket DC API
- Service methods throw errors on HTTP failures (4xx, 5xx responses)
- Need resilience layer to protect against Bitbucket outages

### Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Technology Stack:**

- **Runtime**: Node.js 22+ (native async/await, timers)
- **Logging**: pino (structured JSON logs)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit tests with mocks)

    └── logger.ts               # EXISTING - Logger to be used
```

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Coding Standards:**

- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types
- Use async/await over Promises
- Dependency injection via constructor
- Error handling with try/catch
- TSDoc comments for public APIs
- Constants for magic numbers

### Circuit Breaker Pattern Theory

**State Machine:**

```text
CLOSED ──(failures exceed threshold)──> OPEN
   ▲                                      │
   │                                      │
   │                         (timeout expires)
   │                                      │
   └──(success)── HALF_OPEN ◄────────────┘
        │
        └──(failure)──> OPEN
```

**States Behavior:**

- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, all requests pass through, track failures
- **OPEN**: Fail-fast mode, reject requests immediately without calling downstream
- **HALF_OPEN**: Testing mode, allow limited requests to probe if downstream recovered

**Failure Detection:**

- Consecutive failures: Count sequential errors (5 in a row → OPEN)
- Failure rate: Track success/failure ratio in time window (50% failures in 10s → OPEN)
- Timeout: After circuit opens, wait N seconds before trying again (HALF_OPEN)

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**Integration Point:**

- Circuit breaker wraps `BitbucketClientService.executeOperation()` method
- When circuit is OPEN, return error without calling Bitbucket API
- When circuit is CLOSED or HALF_OPEN, forward request to BitbucketClientService
- Track results and update circuit state accordingly

### Data Models

**Circuit Breaker State:**

```typescript
enum CircuitState {
  CLOSED = 'CLOSED',
  OPEN = 'OPEN',
  HALF_OPEN = 'HALF_OPEN'
}

interface CircuitBreakerConfig {
  failureThreshold: number;          // Number of failures to open (default: 5)
  failureRateThreshold: number;      // Failure rate to open (default: 0.5 = 50%)
  windowSize: number;                // Time window in ms (default: 10000 = 10s)
  timeout: number;                   // Reset timeout in ms (default: 30000 = 30s)
  minimumRequests: number;           // Min requests in window for rate calc (default: 10)
}

interface CircuitBreakerMetrics {
  state: CircuitState;
  failureCount: number;
  successCount: number;
  lastStateChange: Date;
  lastError?: Error;
  totalRequests: number;
  totalFailures: number;
  totalSuccesses: number;
}
```

### Error Handling

**Circuit Breaker Errors:**

```typescript
class CircuitBreakerError extends AppError {
  constructor(message: string, public state: CircuitState) {
    super('CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPEN', message);
  }
}
```

**Usage in BitbucketClientService:**

```typescript
// Wrap existing executeOperation with circuit breaker
async executeOperation(operationId: string, params: any): Promise<any> {
  return await this.circuitBreaker.execute(
    async () => {
      // Existing HTTP call logic
      return await this.httpClient.request(...);
    }
  );
}
```

### Logging Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Log Events:**

- State transitions: `logger.warn('Circuit breaker state changed', { from: 'CLOSED', to: 'OPEN', reason: 'failure threshold exceeded' })`
- Failed requests in CLOSED state: `logger.debug('Request failed', { failureCount, threshold })`
- Rejected requests in OPEN state: `logger.info('Request rejected by circuit breaker', { state: 'OPEN' })`
- Health check in HALF_OPEN: `logger.info('Circuit breaker health check', { result: 'success' })`

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Unit Tests (70%):**

- Mock time using Vitest `vi.useFakeTimers()`
- Test state transitions: CLOSED → OPEN, OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED
- Test failure thresholds: consecutive failures, failure rate in window
- Test timeout and reset logic
- Test concurrent requests handling (race conditions)
- Test metrics tracking and reporting
- Test configuration validation

**Test Coverage Target:** ≥80% for CircuitBreaker class

### Performance Considerations

- Use circular buffer for tracking requests in time window (fixed memory, O(1) operations)
- Avoid storing all request history (memory leak risk)
- Use timestamp-based cleanup for old entries
- Circuit breaker operations should add <1ms latency to requests

### Configuration

**Default Values:**

```typescript
const DEFAULT_CONFIG: CircuitBreakerConfig = {
  failureThreshold: 5,           // 5 consecutive failures
  failureRateThreshold: 0.5,     // 50% failure rate
  windowSize: 10000,             // 10 seconds
  timeout: 30000,                // 30 seconds reset timeout
  minimumRequests: 10            // Min 10 requests to calculate rate
};
```

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_RATE=0.5
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_WINDOW_SIZE=10000
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT=30000
```

    - Resets consecutive failure counter
    - If in HALF_OPEN state → transition to CLOSED (downstream recovered)
    - Adds success record to requestHistory with timestamp

    - Checks if failure threshold exceeded → call `checkThresholds()`
  - [x] Implement public method `getMetrics(): CircuitBreakerMetrics` that returns copy of metrics
  - [x] Add TSDoc comments explaining state machine and usage

- [x] Task 2: Implement threshold checking logic (AC: 5)
  - [x] Implement private method `checkThresholds(): void` that:
    - Calls `checkConsecutiveFailures()`
    - Calls `checkFailureRate()`
    - If either returns true and state is CLOSED → call `setState(OPEN, reason)`
  - [x] Implement private method `checkConsecutiveFailures(): boolean` that:
    - Counts consecutive failures from most recent requestHistory entries
    - Returns true if count >= `config.failureThreshold`
    - Returns false otherwise
  - [x] Implement private method `checkFailureRate(): boolean` that:
    - Filters requestHistory for entries within `config.windowSize` time window
    - Counts failures and successes in window
    - Returns false if total requests < `config.minimumRequests` (insufficient data)

- [x] Task 3: Implement main execute method with state handling (AC: 2, 3, 4, 6)
  - [x] Implement public async method `execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>` that:
    - Increments `metrics.totalRequests`
    - Checks current state:
      - If OPEN: call `tryReset()` to check if timeout expired
      - If still OPEN after tryReset: throw `CircuitBreakerError('Circuit breaker is OPEN, Bitbucket DC may be down', state)`
      - If CLOSED or HALF_OPEN: proceed to execute operation
    - Wraps operation execution in try/catch:
      - Try: `const result = await operation()`
        - On success: call `recordSuccess()` and return result
      - Catch: `catch (error)`
        - Call `recordFailure(error)`
        - Rethrow original error (circuit breaker doesn't swallow errors, only tracks them)
  - [x] Implement private method `tryReset(): void` that:
    - Only executes if state is OPEN
    - Checks if enough time elapsed since last state change: `Date.now() - metrics.lastStateChange.getTime() >= config.timeout`
    - If timeout expired:
      - Call `setState(HALF_OPEN, 'timeout expired, attempting health check')`
      - Reset consecutive failure counter
  - [x] Ensure execute method handles concurrent requests:
    - Multiple simultaneous calls in HALF_OPEN should not cause race conditions
    - Use atomic operations or locks if needed (or accept first result)

- [x] Task 4: Add comprehensive logging (AC: 8)
  - [x] Add debug logs for request tracking:
    - `logger.debug('Circuit breaker executing request', { state, totalRequests: metrics.totalRequests })`
  - [x] Add info logs for rejected requests:
    - In OPEN state when request rejected: `logger.info('Request rejected by circuit breaker', { state: 'OPEN', sinceOpened: timeSinceOpened })`
  - [x] Add warn logs for state transitions (already in setState method):
    - Include: previous state, new state, reason, metrics snapshot
  - [x] Add info logs for health checks in HALF_OPEN:
    - Before allowing test request: `logger.info('Circuit breaker health check starting', { state: 'HALF_OPEN' })`
    - After success: `logger.info('Circuit breaker health check passed', { state: 'CLOSED' })`
    - After failure: `logger.warn('Circuit breaker health check failed', { state: 'OPEN' })`
  - [x] Ensure all logs include relevant context:
    - State, failure counts, success counts, timestamps
    - Sanitize any sensitive data (API keys, tokens) using logger redaction

- [x] Task 5: Add configuration validation and flexibility (AC: 9)
  - [x] Update constructor to validate config:
    - failureThreshold must be > 0
    - failureRateThreshold must be between 0 and 1
    - windowSize must be > 0
    - timeout must be > 0
    - minimumRequests must be > 0
    - Throw Error if invalid: `throw new Error('Invalid circuit breaker config: ...')`
  - [x] Add public method `updateConfig(newConfig: Partial<CircuitBreakerConfig>): void` that:
    - Merges new config with existing
    - Validates merged config
    - Logs config change: `logger.info('Circuit breaker config updated', { config: this.config })`
  - [x] Add static factory method `fromEnv(): CircuitBreaker` that:
    - Reads environment variables: `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_*`
    - Parses and validates values
    - Returns new CircuitBreaker instance with config from env
    - Falls back to defaults if env vars not set

- [x] Task 6: Integrate with BitbucketClientService (AC: 2)
  - [x] Update `src/services/bitbucket-client.ts`:
    - Add private property `circuitBreaker: CircuitBreaker`
    - Inject CircuitBreaker in constructor: `constructor(config, logger, circuitBreaker)`
    - Update `executeOperation()` method to wrap HTTP calls (example implementation):

    ```typescript
    async executeOperation(operationId: string, params: any): Promise<any> {
      return await this.circuitBreaker.execute(async () => {
        // Existing HTTP request logic
        return await this.httpClient.request(...);
      });
    }
    ```

  - [x] Update BitbucketClientService instantiation in `src/index.ts`:

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Execute all unit tests for circuit breaker:

```bash
npm run test:unit -- tests/unit/core/circuit-breaker.test.ts
```

Expected: All tests pass, >80% coverage for circuit-breaker.ts

### Integration Tests

Test circuit breaker integration with BitbucketClientService:

```bash
npm run test:integration -- tests/integration/circuit-breaker-integration.test.ts
```

Expected: Circuit breaker protects against mock HTTP failures, state transitions work correctly

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start MCP server with CircuitBreaker enabled
- [ ] Simulate Bitbucket outage (stop Bitbucket DC instance or block network)
- [ ] Execute multiple operations, observe circuit opens after threshold
- [ ] Verify logs show state transitions with clear reasons
- [ ] Check subsequent operations fail fast (no HTTP attempts)
- [ ] Wait for timeout duration, verify circuit attempts reset
- [ ] Restore Bitbucket connectivity, verify circuit recovers to CLOSED
- [ ] Monitor metrics during normal operation (no false positives)
- [ ] Test with different threshold configurations

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Circuit breaker logs don't contain sensitive data (API tokens, credentials)
- [ ] Error messages from wrapped operations are preserved (don't lose important diagnostic info)
- [ ] Circuit breaker state exposed via metrics doesn't leak security information
- [ ] Configuration validation prevents denial of service (e.g., timeout=0 causing infinite loop)

## Performance Checklist

- [ ] Circuit breaker adds <1ms overhead to requests in CLOSED state
- [ ] Request history uses circular buffer (no unbounded memory growth)
- [ ] Threshold checks are O(n) where n is window size, not total request history
- [ ] Concurrent requests handled safely without locks (or with minimal locking)
