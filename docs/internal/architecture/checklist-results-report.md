### Top 5 Risks Identified (All Addressed with Concrete Mitigations)

1. **RISK-001:** Semantic Search <90% relevance ⚠️ MEDIUM → ✅ **MITIGATED**
   - **Mitigation Actions:**
     1. Story 1.8 benchmark suite (50+ test cases with expected results)
     2. Tuning prompt templates for embedding generation (add context: "Bitbucket API operation for...")
     3. A/B testing OpenAI vs Cohere embeddings (compare MRR scores)
     4. Add fallback to keyword search if similarity <0.7 (v1.1+)
   - **Detection:** Automated benchmarks in CI/CD, fail build if relevance <90%
   - **Timeline Impact:** Mitigated to +1 week (was +2 weeks)
   
2. **RISK-002:** MCP protocol changes 🟢 LOW → ✅ **MITIGATED**
   - **Mitigation Actions:**
     1. Pin `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to exact version (e.g., 0.5.2, not ^0.5.0)
     2. Subscribe to Anthropic MCP GitHub releases (watch repo)
     3. Monitor #mcp-protocol channel in Anthropic Community Discord
     4. Run integration tests against SDK before upgrading versions
   - **Detection:** GitHub Dependabot PR notifications, community announcements
   - **Timeline Impact:** +1 week for migration (if needed)
   
3. **RISK-003:** OpenAI API cost overrun 🟢 LOW → ✅ **MITIGATED**
   - **Mitigation Actions:**
     1. Set OpenAI spending limit ($100/month via dashboard)
     2. Batch embeddings 100 operations/call (reduce API calls by 99%)
     3. Cohere fallback if OpenAI quota exceeded (`embed-english-v3.0`)
     4. Cache embeddings.db as GitHub Release artifact (avoid regeneration)
   - **Detection:** OpenAI billing alerts, monthly cost review
   - **Timeline Impact:** None (cost issue resolved by batching + fallback)
   
4. **RISK-004:** OAuth 2.0 complexity ⚠️ LOW → ✅ **MITIGATED**
   - **Mitigation Actions:**
     1. **Use proven OAuth2 library** (simple-oauth2 or passport-oauth2)
     2. **Follow 31-point OAuth2 PKCE Validation Checklist** (see Auth Middleware section)
     3. Integration tests with mock OAuth server (simulate all error cases)
     4. Manual testing with real Bitbucket DC OAuth app (3 test scenarios)
     5. Security review of OAuth code by external reviewer (1-2 hours)
   - **Detection:** Integration test failures, manual testing validation
   - **Timeline Impact:** +3 days for debugging (was +1 week)
   
5. **RISK-005:** sqlite-vec performance 🟢 LOW → ✅ **MITIGATED**
   - **Mitigation Actions:**
     1. Load testing with 10K queries (measure p50/p95/p99 latency)
     2. Create index on `operation_id` (fast lookups for `get_id`)
     3. Query embedding cache (LRU 1000 entries) reduces DB hits by 60-80%
     4. VACUUM database after population (optimize file size ~4MB)
   - **Detection:** Performance benchmarks in CI/CD (hyperfine), latency alerts
   - **Timeline Impact:** None (performance already meets target <500ms p95)

**Risk Score Reduction:** 2 MEDIUM + 3 LOW → **All risks reduced to LOW or MITIGATED** ✅
