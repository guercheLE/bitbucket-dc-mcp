# Checklist Results Report

### Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 98% ✅ (Updated after gap resolution)

**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right ✅  
O escopo está bem balanceado - 4 epics com 33 stories focadas no core value proposition (semantic search + MCP integration + production resilience + zero-friction setup). Não há scope creep, e cada feature contribui diretamente para validar product-market fit.

**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready ✅  
PRD fornece contexto técnico suficiente para Architect começar imediatamente. Technical assumptions estão bem documentadas, constraints claros, e decisões arquiteturais chave (monorepo, layered monolith, sqlite-vec) já definidas com rationale. Architecture diagrams em formato textual prontos para formalização pelo Architect.

**Critical Gaps:** None - todos os gaps HIGH e MEDIUM priority foram resolvidos:
- ✅ User Research Validation Plan adicionado (Phase 1 e 2 detalhados)
- ✅ Architecture Diagrams incluídos (textual/ASCII, prontos para formalização)
- ✅ Setup Wizard Flow documentado (flow diagram completo)
- ✅ Operational Requirements expandidos (deployment, rollback, monitoring, DR)

---

### Top Issues by Priority

#### 🚫 BLOCKERS: None ✅
All critical requirements for Architect to proceed are present.

#### 🟡 HIGH Priority: ALL RESOLVED ✅
1. ✅ **User Research Validation Plan** - RESOLVED: Added comprehensive Phase 1 (assumption validation) and Phase 2 (beta testing) plan with recruitment channels, validation questions, success criteria
2. ✅ **Architecture Diagrams** - RESOLVED: Added 4 textual/ASCII diagrams (system architecture, auth flow, setup wizard, resilience patterns) ready for Architect to formalize

#### 🟠 MEDIUM Priority: ALL RESOLVED ✅
3. ✅ **Setup Wizard Flow** - RESOLVED: Added complete flow diagram with decision points, error handling, rollback
4. ✅ **Operational Requirements** - RESOLVED: Added deployment scenarios (Docker/npm/bare metal), rollback procedures, monitoring, disaster recovery
5. ✅ **Approval Process** - RESOLVED: Added stakeholder table, approval workflow, sign-off criteria, approval log

#### 🟢 LOW Priority (Deferred - Not Blocking)
6. **Merge Stories 1.7 and 1.8** - DECISION: Keep separate for clear validation separation (CLI tool vs benchmark suite)
7. **Add Health Check Story** - DECISION: Deferred to v1.1 (documented in NFR and operational requirements, not critical for MVP)

---

### MVP Scope Assessment

#### ✅ Scope is Just Right

**Rationale:**
- **Minimal:** 3 core MCP tools + semantic search engine = essential features only
- **Viable:** Production resilience (Epic 3) + setup <5min (Epic 4) = usable product
- **Validating:** Search relevance >90% (Story 1.8) validates core hypothesis
- **Shippable:** 12 weeks for 4 epics is realistic with 2 devs

**Features That Could Be Cut (If Needed):**
- Story 3.4: OAuth 1.0a + Basic Auth (keep OAuth2 + PAT only) - saves 1 week
- Story 4.9: Contributing Guidelines (defer to post-launch) - saves 3 days
- Story 4.10: Beta Testing (reduce scope: 5 testers vs 10-20) - saves 1 week

**Missing Features That Are Essential:** None - scope is complete for MVP

**Complexity Concerns:**
- Story 1.4-1.6: Embeddings generation + sqlite-vec integration é core technical risk - mitigated by Story 1.2 validation spike
- Story 3.2: OAuth 2.0 implementation pode ser complex - mitigated by using established libraries

**Timeline Realism:**
- ✅ 12 weeks / 4 epics = 3 weeks per epic (reasonable)
- ✅ 33 stories / 12 weeks ≈ 2.75 stories/week (achievable com 2 devs)
- ⚠️ Buffer: apenas ~1 week buffer (could add 2-4 weeks to be conservative)

**Recommendation:** Maintain current scope, but communicate 12-16 weeks como realistic range (vs 12 weeks strict)

---

### Technical Readiness

#### ✅ Ready for Architecture Phase

**Clarity of Technical Constraints:** Excellent (9/10)
- Runtime: Node.js 22+ LTS clearly specified
- Language: TypeScript 5.x with strict mode
- Framework: MCP SDK (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
- Database: sqlite-vec for embeddings
- Deployment: Docker multi-arch, npm global package

**Identified Technical Risks:** Well Documented
1. **Semantic Search Accuracy** - Risk: <90% relevance achievable? Mitigation: Technical spike Story 1.4-1.6
2. **MCP Protocol Stability** - Risk: Protocol changes during development? Mitigation: Version pinning, monitoring
3. **sqlite-vec Scale** - Risk: Performance with 1M+ embeddings? Mitigation: Load testing Story 1.8
4. **OAuth 2.0 Complexity** - Risk: Implementation bugs? Mitigation: Using proven libraries, integration tests

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**
1. **Embedding Model Selection** - OpenAI vs Cohere vs local (Story 1.4)
2. **Circuit Breaker Implementation** - Library choice, configuration (Story 3.6)
3. **Multi-tenant Architecture** - Future consideration: shared embeddings vs per-client (noted in Open Questions)

**Score:** 93/100 (Ready)
